# ResNet for Microplastic Classification

ResNet used for microplastic particles classification in "Label-free identification of microplastics in human cells: dark-field microscopy and deep learning study"

### Overview

The repository contains Python scripts defining ResNet architecture and data augmentation parameters based on [ResNet-builder API] (https://akashdesarda.github.io/ResNet-builder/index.html) and dataset consisting of particle images used for training and testing (Mixed-HSF) the model. There are also labels.csv file with labels of test images annotated using Spectral Angle Mapper algorithm and original darkfield images with corresponding hyperspectral images of Mixed-HSF sample.
